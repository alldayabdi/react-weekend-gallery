# Project Name

This project was focused on practicing with React and specifically props, I spent 2 days roughly working on it, I had an issue with naming conventions so I had to work back and change names to better understand what I was attempting to do. The focus of my work was functionality, can a user like a photo and also click the description to see it. Which I was able to do.
